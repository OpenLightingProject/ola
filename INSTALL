A. Basic Installation
==================

  1.  Extract the archive
  	
	tar -zxf lla-0.x.y.tar.gz
	
  2.  Enter the directory
  
  	cd lla-0.x.y.tar.gz

  3.  Run the configure script. If you're using `csh' on an old version of
      System V, you might need to type `sh ./configure' instead to prevent 
      `csh' from trying to execute `configure' itself.
		 
	./configure
	
  4.  Build the source files.
  
  	make

  5.  Run the (simple) unit tests
   
    make check
 
  6. Become root
  	
	su
	(enter root password)

  7. Install

  	make install


C. Installation Paths
=====================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
