# web-interface
the web interface for ola is build using
- [angularjs](http://angularjs.com)
- [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
- [jquery](http://jquery.com)

which are all under the MIT license and thus can be included.

## Compile web-interface
[grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used for the compilation process but first [node](http://nodejs.org/) must be installed for grunt and its plug-ins to be able to work and be downloaded so when node is installed first open a terminal and navigate to this directory then run
```bash
npm install
```
and optionally
```bash
sudo npm install --global grunt-cli
```
to give you a nicer way to run the grunt task runner from the command-line

```bash
grunt build
```
to generate the minified versions of app.js and style.css

## Karma and Coveralls.io
in the future there is the ability to do coverage tests with grunt plug-ins such as [grunt-karma-coveralls](https://github.com/mattjmorrison/grunt-karma-coveralls) which is a plugin for [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/)
