/**
 * @brief An asynchronous RDM Discovery algorithm.
 *
 * This implements the binary search algorithm from the E1.20 standard. The
 * implementation is asynchronous and relies on callbacks to indicate when each
 * step completes.
 *
 * To use the DiscoveryAgent, one should write a class that implements the
 * DiscoveryTargetInterface interface and then pass a pointer to that object to
 * the DiscoveryAgent.
 *
 * The discovery process goes something like this:
 *   - if incremental, copy all previously discovered UIDs to the mute list
 *   - push (0, 0xffffffffffff) onto the resolution stack
 *   - unmute all
 *   - mute all previously discovered UIDs, for any that fail to mute remove
 *     them from the UIDSet.
 *   - Send a discovery unique branch message
 *     - If we get a valid response, mute, and send the same branch again
 *     - If we get a collision, split the UID range, and try each branch
 *       separately.
 *
 * We also track responders that fail to ack a mute request (we attempt to mute
 * MAX_MUTE_ATTEMPTS times) and branches that contain responders which continue
 * to respond once muted. The latter causes a branch to be marked as corrupt,
 * which prevents us from looping forver.
