/**
 * Holds the registrations for services and ages & cleans them as appropriate.
 * Each service registration has an associated lifetime (age). Openslp ages the
 * entire database every 15 seconds which doesn't provide a good client
 * experience.
 *
 * We take a different approach, by opportunistically aging the database
 * whenever insert or lookup is called. If it's been more than
 * a second since the last aging event for a service, we age all entries.
 *
 * We store a map of canonical service name to ServiceList structures. Each
 * ServiceList has a timestamp of when it was last aged / cleaned and a list of
 * ServiceEntries.
 *
 * Clean() should be called periodically to age & remove any entries for
 * services where there have no been any Insert / Lookup requests. Not
 * calling Clean() won't result in incorrect results, but memory use will
 * grow over time.
 *
 * For the E1.33 case we'll have:
 *   - single scope
 *   - two services
 *   - many URLs.
