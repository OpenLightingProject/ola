.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdm_test_server.py
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Starts the TestServer (A simple Web Server) which run a series of tests on a
RDM responder and displays the results in a Web UI. This requires the OLA
server to be running, and the RDM device to have been detected. You can
confirm this by running ola_rdm_discover \fB\-u\fR UNIVERSE. This will send SET
commands to the broadcast UIDs which means the start address, device label
etc. will be changed for all devices connected to the responder. Think twice
about running this on your production lighting rig.
