.SH NAME
rdm_responder_test.py \- Test RDM responders for adherence to the standards
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdm_responder_test.py
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI<uid>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run a series of tests on a RDM responder to check the behaviour. This requires
the OLA server to be running, and the RDM device to have been detected. You
can confirm this by running ola_rdm_discover \fB\-u\fR UNIVERSE.  This will send SET
commands to the broadcast UIDs which means the start address, device label
etc. will be changed for all devices connected to the responder. Think twice
about running this on your production lighting rig.
