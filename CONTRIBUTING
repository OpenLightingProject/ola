Contributing to Open Lighting Architecture (OLA)
===============================================================================

There are lots of ways you can help with OLA, such as running a Buildbot or
writing documentation or user guides.

If you’d like to contribute code (such as a new plugin, extending an existing
feature or adding a brand new one), our preferred method is by forking us on
GitHub, committing your code to there, then opening a pull request. We can then
review and comment on your code if necessary and merge it in. It will also get
checked automatically by GitHub Actions (you will see a message
within the pull request showing the status of the GitHub tests); hence why we
prefer pull requests to other methods such as patch submissions.

When writing code, please read the README.developer file which covers coding
style, the code review process and various other guidelines.
