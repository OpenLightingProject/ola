 *
 * Common includes for both the lexer and parser.
 *
 * The contents of %union are copied to config.tab.h and included in lex.yy.c
 * and config.tab.cpp. Since our %union uses strings, vectors and classes like
 * ValueInterval, we need to include these headers in config.tab.h
 *
 * Unfortunately, bison 2.3 (which is what's installed on OS X) pre-dates %code
 * directives so I can't find a way to insert includes into config.tab.h. The
 * alternative is to put everything we need here, and include ConfigCommon.h in
 * both lex.yy.c and config.tab.cpp. It's a bit messy but it works.
