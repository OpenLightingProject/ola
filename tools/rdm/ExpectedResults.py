#
# Expected result classes are broken down as follows:
#
# BaseExpectedResult - the base class
#  BroadcastResult   - expects the request to be broadcast
#  SuccessfulResult  - expects a well formed response from the device
#   NackResult       - parent NACK class
#    NackGetResult   - expects GET_COMMAND_RESPONSE with a NACK
#    NackSetResult   - expects SET_COMMAND_RESPONSE with a NACK
#   AckResult        - parent ACK class
#    AckGetResult    - expects GET_COMMAND_RESPONSE with an ACK
#    AckSetResult    - expects SET_COMMAND_RESPONSE with an ACK
#   QueuedMessageResult - expects an ACK or NACK for any PID other than
#                         QUEUED_MESSAGE
