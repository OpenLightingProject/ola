Nanoleaf Plugin
============

This plugin creates a device per IP, each with one output port. Each port
represents a Nanoleaf Aurora controller, with up to 30 panels attached.
This plugin uses the streaming external control effects functionality of
the Aurora OpenAPI.

Currently only the [Nanoleaf
Aurora](https://nanoleaf.me/en/consumer-led-lighting/products/
smarter-series/nanoleaf-light-panels-smarter-kit/)
is supported.
