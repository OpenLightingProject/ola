FTDI USB Chipset DMX Plugin
===========================

This plugin is compatible with Enttec Open DMX USB and other FTDI chipset
based USB to DMX converters where the host needs to create the DMX stream
itself and not the interface (the interface has no microprocessor to do so).


## Config file: ola-ftdidmx.conf

`frequency = 30`  
The DMX stream frequency (30 to 44 Hz max are the usual).
