FTDI USB Chipset DMX Plugin
===========================

This plugin is compatible with Enttec OpenDmx and other FTDI chipset based
USB to DMX converters where the host needs to create the DMX stream itself
and not the interface (the interface has no microprocessor to do so).


## Config file: ola-ftdidmx.conf

`frequency = 30`  
The DMX stream frequency (30 to 44 Hz max are the usual).
