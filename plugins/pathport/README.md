Pathway Pathport Plugin
=======================

This plugin creates a single device with 5 input and 5 output ports.

The universe the port is patched to corresponds with the DMX channels used
in the PathPort protocol. For example universe 0 is xDMX channels 0 - 511,
universe 1 is xDMX channels 512 - 1023.
