This readme should also apply to Ubuntu and probably
other Debian-based distributions as well.

If you extracted a tarball you should be able to run

$ debuild

in the top level directory to create a set of .debs

If you're building from the git repo do the following:

$ autoreconf
$ ./configure
$ make dist
$ cp ola-0.X.Y.tar.gz /tmp
$ cd /tmp
$ tar -zxf ola-0.X.Y.tar.gz
$ cd ola-0.X.Y
$ debuild

If autoreconf reports missing things, you can add the -i option.
Running configure might report missing utilities and libraries. You
can install these with apt-get.

The list below is probably not complete. Some of the package-names
may differ between Debian and Debian-like distributions. Adjust
as necessary.

$ sudo apt-get install libcppunit-dev libcppunit-1.13-0 uuid-dev pkg-config \
      libncurses5-dev libtool autoconf automake g++ libmicrohttpd-dev \
      libmicrohttpd10 protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-lite10 python-protobuf \
      libprotobuf-dev libprotoc-dev zlib1g-dev bison flex make libftdi-dev \
      libftdi1 libusb-1.0-0-dev liblo-dev libavahi-client-dev python-numpy

Note: Some distributions may offer older or newer versions of packages.
For example, libprotobuf-lite6 or libprotobuf-lite7 instead of libprotobuf-lite8.

The build system allows for checks/tests to be run.
$ make check
